# uwu-files

This repo contains all the config files I need to set up my workflow

1. dot files: mostly just zsh and i3
2. bash aliases: git shortcuts and destinations I use v frequently
3. init script for dot files: copies config files from this repo to the paths expected by each corresponding program:

- to set up the config, run `./init_linux.sh` for linux or `./init_mac.sh` for mac
- make sure you have zsh installed (https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

## oh my zsh extensions (install these)

- [git-open](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open)

instructions and inspo from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dive-into-dotfiles-part-2-6321b4a73608)

# mac programs
``` bash
# https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen
curl -L git.io/antigen > ~/antigen.zsh
```

# Programs/Packages I'm currently using (linux)
